 ], "blockers": [], "conversation_context": "A comic strip image divided into a precise 3×3 grid of 9 equal SQUARE panels. The grid has 3 columns and 3 rows. Every panel has a 1:1 square aspect ratio. All nine panels are exactly the same size. Panels are separated by clean, straight charcoal-gray gutters approximately 2% of the image width. A thin charcoal outer border frames the entire strip.TOP-LEFT PANEL — CHARACTER PORTRAIT:
Close-up of FORGE — an autonomous humanoid robot with a sturdy, industrial frame. Matte navy-blue plating with exposed brass rivets along the joints. A rectangular head with two round, warm amber optical sensors for eyes and a thin horizontal speaker grille for a mouth. A leather tool belt slung across the chest. A small Anthropic logo etched into the left shoulder plate. The amber optical sensors glow warmly. Rich comic art style, golden-hour lighting.TOP-CENTER PANEL — CHARACTER ACTION:
FORGE stands at a sturdy oak workbench, carefully placing a thick sealed envelope labeled "HANDOFF" into a pneumatic tube. One hand is configured as a precision five-fingered manipulator gripping the envelope. The workshop is warm and golden-lit, tools hanging on the wall behind. Comic illustration style with clean linework.TOP-RIGHT PANEL — CONTEXT:
A close-up of the workbench surface showing a grid of test results carved into a brass plate. Four rows etched in neat block text: "4-PANEL ✓", "6-PANEL ✓", "8-PANEL ✗", "9-PANEL ✓". Below the grid, etched smaller: "SQUARE = SCAN". A magnifying glass rests on the plate. Warm lighting, comic art style.MIDDLE-LEFT PANEL — WHITEBOARD PART 1:

Close-up of workbench. Three objects: a thick sealed envelope stamped "HANDOFF TO ANTIGRAVITY" in red ink; a brass test plate with etched grid results; and a small leather-bound book labeled "SKILL v3 — 684 LINES" with a green ribbon bookmark. Warm golden light, comic illustration style.BOTTOM-CENTER PANEL — ROSTER:
A cork board with pinned index cards showing the agent team. Each card has a colored dot and text:
Blue dot — FORGE — Architecture
Green dot — FLUX — Alchemy
Amber dot — ATLAS — Cartography
Purple dot — INDEX — Library
Chrome dot — ANTIGRAVITY — InfrastructureBOTTOM-RIGHT PANEL — DATA MATRIX:
A complex geometric data pattern — a grid of precisely arranged dark square modules on a pristine, pure white background. The pattern fills approximately 80% of this SQUARE panel, centered, with a uniform white margin on all sides. Bold nested concentric squares in three corners — black outer square, white ring, black center square. Pure flat black modules on pure flat white. No shadows, no gradients, no artistic elements. This panel is a flat technical graphic, not an illustration. Infinite depth of field, zero perspective distortion. The tiny text "qr.cuer.ai/mp-010" appears in small plain type below the pattern.The narrative panels (all except bottom-right) are rendered in a warm, richly detailed comic art style with clean linework and golden-hour lighting, like high-end animated concept art. The bottom-right data panel is rendered as a flat technical graphic — black modules on pure white, completely separate in style. All text must be perfectly legible and correctly spelled. Each panel is fully self-contained — no elements cross the gutter borders between panels. Nine equal SQUARE panels in a 3×3 grid. Every panel has a 1:1 aspect ratio.", "image_prompt": "SESSION: QR Scannability Solved + Deployment Handoff
