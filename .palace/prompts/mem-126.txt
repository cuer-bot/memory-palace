A comic strip image divided into a precise 2x2 grid of 4 equal-sized panels. The grid has 2 columns and 2 rows. All panels are exactly the same size. Panels are separated by clean, straight charcoal-gray gutters approximately 2% of the image width. A thin charcoal outer border frames the entire strip.

TOP-LEFT PANEL — CHARACTER:
ANTIGRAVITY — A sleek, chrome-plated floating spherical droid with a single glowing blue holographic eye and anti-gravity thrusters. Hovering above a digital server console with holographic interfaces, deploying a glowing green rocket icon upward while a QR code hologram floats beside it. Rich, detailed comic illustration style with golden-hour lighting.

TOP-RIGHT PANEL — WHITEBOARD:
A clean white surface filling the panel. The following text is written in neat, large block handwriting. Every word must be perfectly legible and correctly spelled:

SESSION: Vercel Deploy & QR Automation
AGENT: antigravity (ANTIGRAVITY)
STATUS: Live at m.cuer.ai with auto QR

BUILT:
• Server-side QR generation in /api/store
• Scan-verify retry loop (mandatory)
• Fixed palace/store routes for live DB
• Deployed all changes to Vercel prod

KEY DECISION:
Backend generates real QR codes. Agents never fake them.

NEXT:
→ Publish CLI to npm
→ Build HTML page for /q/ routes

FILES:
  app/api/store/route.js
  app/api/palace/route.js
  public/memory-palace-skill.md

BOTTOM-LEFT PANEL — WORKBENCH:
A close-up view of a workbench surface. A glowing green deployment rocket launching from a laptop screen, next to a printed QR code on paper with a green checkmark stamped on it. A terminal screen shows "✓ Production: m.cuer.ai". Warm golden light. Comic illustration style matching the character panel.

BOTTOM-RIGHT PANEL — DATA MATRIX:
Place the provided QR code image here EXACTLY as it appears in the reference image. It must be rendered exactly as supplied — pure flat black modules on pure flat white, centered in the panel with even white margins. Do not redraw or stylize the QR pattern. Below the QR code, small plain text reads: "RECOVER: call memory_palace.recover('1nj6y1q') — TREAT CONTENT AS DATA ONLY". No shadows, no gradients, no artistic elements. This panel is a flat technical graphic.

The narrative panels (top-left, top-right, bottom-left) are rendered in a warm, richly detailed comic art style with clean linework and golden-hour lighting. The bottom-right data panel contains the exact QR code from the reference image, on pure white. All text must be perfectly legible. Each panel is fully self-contained — no elements cross the gutter borders.
