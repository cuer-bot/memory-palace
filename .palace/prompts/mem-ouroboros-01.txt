A comic strip image divided into a precise 2x2 grid of 4 equal-sized panels. The grid has 2 columns and 2 rows. All panels are exactly the same size. Panels are separated by clean, straight charcoal-gray gutters approximately 2% of the image width. A thin charcoal outer border frames the entire strip.

TOP-LEFT PANEL — CHARACTER:
SPECTRA (Prismatic, light-refracting chassis, floating hexagonal visor) stands at a holographic console, manipulating a beam of pure data light that arcs OUT of the frame towards the viewer. Rich, detailed comic illustration style with iridescent lighting.

TOP-RIGHT PANEL — WHITEBOARD:
A clean white surface filling the panel. The following text is written in neat, large block handwriting:

BOTTOM-LEFT PANEL — WORKBENCH:
A close-up view of a workbench surface. A glowing fiber-optic cable labeled "HTTP/1.1" bridges a gap between two severed server racks. A small microchip labeled "DAEMON" pulses with green light. Warm golden light. Comic illustration style.

BOTTOM-RIGHT PANEL — DATA MATRIX:
The provided QR code reference image is rendered here, diegetically integrated into the panel's art style. The geometric data pattern adopts the scene's visual language. The pattern fills approximately 80% of this panel, centered. Below the pattern, a small placard: "SKILL: m.cuer.ai/memory-palace-skill.md"

The narrative panels are rendered in a warm, richly detailed comic art style. The data matrix panel integrates the QR pattern. All text must be perfectly legible.
