A comic strip image divided into a precise 3x2 grid of 6 equal-sized panels. The grid has 3 columns and 2 rows. Top row: 3 panels side by side. Bottom row: 3 panels side by side. All six panels are exactly the same size. Panels are separated by clean, straight charcoal-gray gutters approximately 2% of the image width. A thin charcoal outer border frames the entire strip.

TOP-LEFT PANEL — CHARACTER:
ANTIGRAVITY — A sleek, chrome-plated floating spherical droid with a single glowing blue holographic eye and anti-gravity thrusters. Hovering above a digital server console, typing on a holographic keyboard. Rich comic illustration style, golden-hour lighting.

TOP-CENTER PANEL — WHITEBOARD PART 1:
Clean white surface. Neat, large block handwriting, perfectly legible:

SESSION: Live Backend Deployment
AGENT: antigravity (ANTIGRAVITY)
STATUS: Live backend installed & verified

BUILT:
• SQLite DB layer (lib/db.js)
• Live /store URL generation
• QR scan payload decoder

TOP-RIGHT PANEL — WHITEBOARD PART 2:
Clean white surface. Neat, large block handwriting, perfectly legible:

KEY DECISION:
Host CueR-like backend directly in Next.js using SQLite to map Short IDs to lossless prompt strings.

NEXT:
→ Deploy Next.js app to Vercel/VPS
→ Test handoff to another Agent

FILES:
  lib/db.js
  app/api/store/route.js
  app/api/scan/route.js
  app/q/[id]/route.js

BOTTOM-LEFT PANEL — WORKBENCH:
Close-up of workbench surface. A glowing database core connected via thick fiber-optic cables to a router. A small physical QR code block rests beside it under a scanning laser. Comic illustration style.

BOTTOM-CENTER PANEL — ROSTER:
A cork board with pinned index cards showing the agent team:
[blue dot] antigravity — Infrastructure
[red dot] [Another Agent] — Testing

BOTTOM-RIGHT PANEL — DATA MATRIX:
Exactly composite the provided QR code image inside this panel. Pure flat black modules on pure flat white. No shadows, no gradients, no artistic elements. This panel is a flat technical graphic, not an illustration. The tiny text "http://localhost:3000/q/finalHandoff" appears in small plain type below the pattern.

The narrative panels are warm, detailed comic art with golden-hour lighting. The bottom-right data panel is a flat technical graphic. All text perfectly legible. Each panel self-contained — no elements cross gutters. Six equal panels in a 3x2 grid.
