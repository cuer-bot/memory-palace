A comic strip image divided into a precise 3x3 grid of 9 equal SQUARE panels. The grid has 3 columns and 3 rows. Every panel has a 1:1 square aspect ratio. All nine panels are exactly the same size. Panels are separated by clean, straight charcoal-gray gutters approximately 2% of the image width. A thin charcoal outer border frames the entire strip.

TOP-LEFT PANEL — CHARACTER PORTRAIT:
Close-up of ANTIGRAVITY — A sleek, chrome-plated floating spherical droid with a single glowing blue holographic eye and anti-gravity thrusters. Warm lighting, rich comic art style.

TOP-CENTER PANEL — CHARACTER ACTION:
ANTIGRAVITY at their workstation, hovering over a digital server console, typing on a holographic keyboard. Full body visible with station environment. Comic illustration style, golden-hour lighting.

TOP-RIGHT PANEL — CONTEXT:
A glowing database core connected via thick fiber-optic cables to a router, signifying the live SQLite backend that was just deployed.

MIDDLE-LEFT PANEL — WHITEBOARD PART 1:
Clean white surface. Neat, large block handwriting, perfectly legible:

SESSION: Architecture Complete
AGENT: antigravity (ANTIGRAVITY)
STATUS: Live SQLite backend installed

BUILT:
• SQLite DB layer (lib/db.js)
• Live /store URL generation
• QR scan payload decoder

MIDDLE-CENTER PANEL — WHITEBOARD PART 2:
Clean white surface. Neat, large block handwriting, perfectly legible:

KEY DECISION:
Host CueR-like backend directly in Next.js using SQLite.
Map Short IDs to lossless prompt strings. Local paths also supported for offline parsing.
Transition memory images to 9-panel perfectly square geometry for maximum QR fidelity.

NEXT:
→ Test handoff to another Agent
→ Agent reads this 9-panel block

MIDDLE-RIGHT PANEL — WHITEBOARD PART 3:
Clean white surface. Neat, large block handwriting, perfectly legible:

FILES:
  lib/db.js
  app/api/store/route.js
  app/api/scan/route.js
  app/q/[id]/route.js

BOTTOM-LEFT PANEL — WORKBENCH:
Close-up of workbench surface with physical file folder icon containing a text document and a small physical QR code block being etched by a laser. Comic illustration style.

BOTTOM-CENTER PANEL — ROSTER:
A cork board with pinned index cards showing the agent team:
[blue dot] antigravity — Infrastructure Deployer
[red dot] [Another Agent] — Handoff Recipient

BOTTOM-RIGHT PANEL — DATA MATRIX:
Exactly composite the provided QR code image inside this panel. Pure flat black modules on pure flat white. No shadows, no gradients, no artistic elements. This panel is a flat technical graphic, not an illustration. The tiny text "http://localhost:3000/q/finalHandoff" appears in small plain type below the pattern.

The narrative panels are warm, detailed comic art with golden-hour lighting. The bottom-right data panel is a flat technical graphic. All text perfectly legible. Each panel self-contained — no elements cross gutters. Nine equal SQUARE panels in a 3x3 grid. Every panel has a 1:1 aspect ratio.
